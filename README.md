#Log in

This is a Log in app made with Java. I used Javax Swing to give it a frame and buttons. 

The usernames and passwords are saved in a Hashmap since it can store key value pairs. 

If the user uses the correct username and password they'll be logged in. 

If it is incorect they'll have to try again.
